    <h1>Privacy — Plain-language summary</h1>
    <p class="lede">Leocyte respects privacy and treats personal data carefully. This page gives a short summary and a legal appendix describing our practices under the LGPD (Brazil), GDPR (EU) and CCPA (US). A full editable privacy policy template is available in <code>/_data/privacy-policy-template.txt</code>.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact info</strong> (name, email, organization) — to respond to requests and manage relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional & company data</strong> — to evaluate suitability for deals and partnerships.</li>
        <li><strong>Uploaded documents</strong> (e.g., NDAs, term sheets) — to perform diligence and structure deals; stored only as required and with restricted access.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies & analytics</strong> — minimal website telemetry to improve the site. Analytics run only after consent for analytics cookies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we protect data</h2>
      <p>We use role-based access controls, encryption at rest and in transit, and detailed access logs. For uploaded commercial documents we recommend encrypted file transfer (SFTP or encrypted links) and storing DPA-backed contracts before sharing sensitive data. See assets/README.md for security recommendations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How long we keep information</h2>
      <p>We retain basic contact and contractual records for business and legal purposes (typically up to 7 years unless law requires otherwise). Analytical cookies are retained per your consent settings and for no longer than necessary.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Rights & requests</h2>
      <p>You can request access, correction, restriction, portability, or deletion of personal data. To exercise rights or lodge a complaint contact: <a href="mailto:AlloAllo@leocyte.com">AlloAllo@leocyte.com</a>. We will respond as required by applicable law (LGPD/GDPR timelines typically within 30 days; may vary by jurisdiction).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we handle uploaded documents / NDAs</h2>
      <p>Uploaded documents and NDAs are treated as confidential client material. We:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Store them on encrypted storage with restricted access.</li>
        <li>Log access and retain a minimum necessary copy for diligence and contractual fulfilment.</li>
        <li>Offer secure transfer methods on request (SFTP, password-protected links, or secure virtual datarooms).</li>
        <li>Remove or return documents on request or at the conclusion of engagement, subject to legal retention requirements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Legal appendix (LGPD, GDPR, CCPA) — key points</h2>
      <p>This appendix outlines lawful bases, rights, international transfers, and cookie practices in plain language.</p>

      <h3>Lawful bases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> Processing necessary to perform agreements (e.g., diligence, contract formation).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> For business communications, fraud prevention and ensuring lawful operations (balanced against rights and interests of data subjects).</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For marketing communications and optional analytics/marketing cookies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data subject rights</h3>
      <p>Data subjects have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, object and request portability. Requests may be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:AlloAllo@leocyte.com">AlloAllo@leocyte.com</a> — we will verify identity and respond per applicable law.</p>

      <h3>Data Protection Officer (DPO) / Contact</h3>
      <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:AlloAllo@leocyte.com">AlloAllo@leocyte.com</a> (DPO / data privacy contact — replace with your DPO details here).</p>

      <h3>International transfers</h3>
      <p>Where data is transferred internationally we use appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), adequacy decisions where available, or lawful derogations when permitted.</p>

      <h3>Cookies & analytics</h3>
      <p>We use essential cookies for site operation and no analytics until you consent. You may grant or withdraw analytics and marketing consents at any time via the cookie banner (see cookie-consent.js).</p>

      <h3>Retention & deletion</h3>
      <p>Retention periods are minimized and documented. Deletion requests are actioned unless retention is required by law or contract; for NDAs or documents related to closed deals a retention policy will be communicated in the contract.</p>

      <h3>Security incidents</h3>
      <p>We maintain an incident response plan and will notify affected individuals and supervisory authorities as required by LGPD/GDPR timelines.</p>
